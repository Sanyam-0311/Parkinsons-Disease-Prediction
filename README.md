# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for predicting Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `parkinsons_prediction.py` script.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various attributes related to vocal features. These attributes are used to predict whether a person has Parkinson's disease or not.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) includes visualizations of various attributes and their correlations.

## Machine Learning Models

The following machine learning models were applied:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- K Neighbors Classifier
- Support Vector Machine

The best performing models were the Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier.

## Results

- Random Forest Classifier Accuracy: XX%
- Decision Tree Classifier Accuracy: XX%
- ...

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored the prediction of Parkinson's disease using machine learning. The Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier provided the highest accuracy.
